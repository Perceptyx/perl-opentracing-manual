# OpenTracing Manaual

## Introduction

From the OpenTracin IO website:

> OpenTracing is comprised of an API specification, frameworks and libraries
> that have implemented the specification, and documentation for the project.
> OpenTracing allows developers to add instrumentation to their application code
> using APIs that do not lock them into any one particular product or vendor.

> Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used
> to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a
> microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures
> occur and what causes poor performance.
