OpenTracing::Manual - A quick overview about Perl5 and OpenTracing



=head1 WARNING

The C<OpenTracing> module on CPAN is B<NOT COMPLIANT> with anything remotely to
L<OpenTracing.IO|https://opentracing.io> or the L<OpenTracing::Interface>.

B<DO NOT USE THE OPENTRACING PACKAGE>



=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Manual is a quick overview of what is available in Perl related to the
OpenTracing API related Interface Definition.

This manual targets three different audiences:

=over

=item Application developers and Devops

Those that want to add instrumentation and tracing to their appilication or
micro services.

=item Framework or Integration Developers

Those writing integrations for frameworks, such that those can easily extract
tracing information from incoming request or inject that into outgoing requests.

=item Tracing service Implementation providers

Those that want to have the Perl Implementation communicate with their tracing
service provider.

=back

Included is a list of Perl Modules and those that are on the horizon.



=head1 INTRODUCTION

From the OpenTracing IO website:

OpenTracing is comprised of an API specification, frameworks and libraries
that have implemented the specification, and documentation for the project.
OpenTracing allows developers to add instrumentation to their application code
using APIs that do not lock them into any one particular product or vendor.

Distributed tracing, also called distributed request tracing, is a method used
to profile and monitor applications, especially those built using a
microservices architecture. Distributed tracing helps pinpoint where failures
occur and what causes poor performance.

See also: L<OpenTracing Overview|https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/>.



=head1 THE MANUAL



=head2 For Application developers and Devops

=head3 Adding OpenTracing to your Application

From the point of view for application developers that want to add
instrumentation, most likely it is just a matter of adding the right plugin to
your framework or useragent.

    use YourFramework::Plugin::OpenTracing;
    #
    # use OPENTRACING_IMPLEMENTATION environment variable to select which.

This will bootstrap a Tracer Implementation, use
L<< C<extract_context>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/"extract_context(-OPENTRACING_CARRIER_FORMAT-=>-$carrier-)" >> and
L<< C<start_active_span>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/"start_active_span(-$operation_name,-%options-)" >>
with any already existing Tracer information.

If your microservices are 'small' and 'shallow' this might be just enough what
you need. However, you will only get tracer information on the level provided by
the plugin. That is, probably just one single rootspan. Some framework plugins
might add another layer on top of that rootspan, like a setup-span, a run-span,
a render-span, and a teardown-span.

Incase you want more detailed information, see the next.

=head3 Getting Access to the bootstrapped Tracer

To get access to the Tracer, there are two ways to do so:

    use OpenTracing::GlobalTracer qw/$TRACER/;
    #
    # which might be `undef` if not yet bootstrapped

Or use a more reliable way:

    use aliased OpenTracing::GlobalTracer;
    
    my $tracer = GlobalTracer->get_global_tracer;
    #
    # which will always return a tracer (or croak)

In the latter approach, it may return a L<OpenTracing::Implementation::NoOp> as
defined in the specs. But at least your application won't break because of some
badly bootstrapped tracer, and 'production' can continue running.

In the examples below, C<$TRACER> will be used, but you should have used the
class method to get one.

=head3 Use of Baggage Items for Request Parameters

During some setup-stage, add Baggage Items, using L<< set_baggage_item|
OpenTracing::Interface::Span/set_baggage_item(-$key-=>-$value-) >>

    my $customer_id = YourFramwork->request->query_param('customer_id);
        
    $TRACER
        ->get_active_span
        ->set_baggage_item( customer_id => $customer_id );

Those Baggage Items will be progressed into all descendent spans and delivered
to the Tracing Provider.

=head3 Manually adding Spans

If you like to get more detail, you can add more
L<Spans|OpenTracing::Interface::Span>. For simplicity, Spans do
live inside a L<Scope|OpenTracing::Interface::Scope>, handled by a
L<ScopeManager|OpenTracing::Interface::ScopeManager>. Starting a Span will
return a Scope. According to the spec, once finished the scope this Span lives
in, one needs to call L<< C<close>|OpenTracing::Interface::Scope/"close" >>.

    sub exciting_task {
        my $_scope = $TRACER->start_active_span( "exiting task" );
        
        ...
        
        $_scope->close;
        
        return
    }

This can be annoying and even terrible if there are multiple exit points, using
I<return early> concepts, or when bailing out halfway.

This being Perl, we can do better using L<OpenTracing::AutoScope>:

    use OpenTracing::AutoScope;
    
    sub exciting_task {
        OpenTracing::AutoScope->start_guarded_span;
        
        ...
        
        return
    }

See L<< C<start_active_span>|OpenTracing::Interface::Tracer/start_active_span(-$operation_name,-%options-) >>
for all the options you can pass in.
